            <p>I've been in the IT world for more than 2 decades now, but even though I've have done</p>
            <p>some programming in the past, I can't really say I did, let alone a full web application.</p>
            <p>So, long story short, after some family discussion plus some internal debate the path was clear:</p>
            <p>I had to do it. I had to get back on track and do what makes me happy even if it meant to</p>
            <p>quit a well paid job. So I did...no regrets at all.</p>
